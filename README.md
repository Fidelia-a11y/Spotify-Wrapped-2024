# Delivery Performance BI Dashboard📊

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a Spotify user's complete music streaming history to uncover insights about their listening behavior over 2023 and 2024. The goal is to identify top artists, track skipping patterns, and the frequency of discovering new artists.

---
